<p>Ain't nobody you can call in Shinytown, friend.  Least, no one who can hear ya.  Ol' Jeselwel lost his hearing to a pritterbug five twists ago.  He also lost his eyes when he spied a god in the cracks of his house, what with glowing in a million folds an' all.  His ability to feel pain went after eating too many elysiberries, so he's covered in wounds all the time.  Kinesthesia went after he floated off the earth for a spell and came back in upside down.  So now he's covered in wounds, his limbs flailing all akimbo, eyes melted out 'is head, and deaf as the Mountain itself.  Then today he gets his guts cut out by a Gentleman Gouger, so he can't eat nothing.  He jest straggles from plot to plot, burying himself in dirt up to his chest, getting nutrition from the soil like a plant.

Anyways, no one can hear ya if'n you need help, is what I'm saying.</p>
